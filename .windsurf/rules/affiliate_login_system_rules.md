# Windsurf Development Principles

These principles guide our development process to ensure high-quality, maintainable, and efficient code.

1.  **Contextual Review:**
    *   **Rule:** Always refer back to related files and existing code structures before implementing new features or making changes.
    *   **Purpose:** To ensure consistency, reduce redundancy, and minimize errors by understanding the broader context.

2.  **Incremental Implementation:**
    *   **Rule:** Break down complex functions and features into smaller, manageable parts. Implement and test these parts incrementally.
    *   **Purpose:** To simplify development, facilitate easier debugging, and reduce the likelihood of introducing complex errors.

3.  **Clarity in Problem Solving:**
    *   **Rule:** When addressing issues or making changes, clearly document or explain:
        *   The root cause of the problem (`Why this happened`).
        *   The proposed solution and its implementation (`How to solve it`).
    *   **Purpose:** To improve understanding, maintainability, and knowledge sharing within the team.

4.  **Adherence to Best Practices:**
    *   **Rule:** Consistently follow established coding best practices, design patterns, and project-specific guidelines.
    *   **Purpose:** To produce robust, secure, and maintainable code that is easy for others to understand and contribute to.

5.  **Simplicity and Efficiency in Code:**
    *   **Rule:** Strive for code that is both simple to understand and efficient in performance. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
    *   **Purpose:** To enhance readability, reduce the cognitive load for developers, and ensure optimal application performance.

6.  **Concise Communication:**
    *   **Rule:** Keep all explanations, comments, and documentation clear, concise, and directly to the point.
    *   **Purpose:** To ensure effective communication and prevent misunderstandings.

7.  **Focused Code Presentation:**
    *   **Rule:** When presenting code modifications, show only the specific lines or sections being changed (i.e., a diff or snippet). Do not display the entire file unless explicitly requested by the user.
    *   **Purpose:** To keep the focus on the relevant changes, reduce noise, and make reviews more efficient.
